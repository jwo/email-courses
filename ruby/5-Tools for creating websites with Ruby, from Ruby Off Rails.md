Hi there! This is email number 5 of 8 in the 'What you need to know about Ruby' email course you signed up for on RubyOffRails.com. If I am not creating value for you with these emails, you can unsubscribe with 1 click at the end of this email.

Ability to Create Websites

Most of the work you'll do as a software developer this decade will be creating website and web applications. After you complete the RubyOffRails course, you'll have the ability to create websites using three different tools:

Sinatra - a small, swift website with a great API. It's simple to use, and great for creating sites that collect data, or sites that distribute data through an API.
Jekyll - a framework to create HTML based websites. You'll configure your app, using Ruby if needed, and publish a set of HTML pages. Simple, direct, and just what the doctor asked for when it comes to Blogs, coming soon, and about-us websites.
Middleman - a static site generator with more power; it has an asset optimizer for images and javascript, and is perfect for prototyping sites for AngularJS and Ember.
More Productive Overall

Let's say your like most Ruby programmers and have a Mac (or want a Mac). Knowing Ruby is a gateway to knowing Unix. You'll end up knowing how to fork processes, and understand things like

"cat orders.txt | grep 'gmail' | awk -F\, '{print $1}'"

Most Ruby programs are deploying onto linux environments, so you'll end up learning *nix (unix/linux/bsd) by accident. And you'll like it!

Connection with Students

With RubyOffRails, you'll be able to see what other students have done with their code: all code submissions are open source and available for other students to look at, comment on, and learn from.

Students have reported an immediate connection with other students. You'll enjoy learning from others in addition to learning from me.

Learn More Over Time

In addition to getting new RubyOffRails episodes monthly, you'll be encouraged to go back to old episodes and try a harder level than you did the first time. For example, the first time through the TDD episodes, you might only do the "Panda" level. Once you get your sea legs and comfortable with TDD, you'll come back and add on to your existing code with the more difficult Tiger level.

Who Should Not Buy

Ruby Off Rails isn't for everyone. If you dislike seeing people solve problems in real time, or if you won't be able to find 1 hour a month to watch a Ruby video, then Ruby Off Rails is not for you.

If you are only mildly serious about learning Ruby, please do not buy this course. I only want your money if you're getting value from Ruby Off Rails, and if you're not committing to being a happier developer, it's not right for you.
