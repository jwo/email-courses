"Since you're about to create an Android app for me, could you
also install this WordPress theme?"

Danger, danger, danger!

You're about to say "yes" and fall into the jack-of-all-trades
problem. You see, you're pretty darn smart; you can do most
things computer. But should you? Let's examine.

* Entrepreneurs are jacks-of-all-trades; it's part of the
qualifications of going out of your own.
* Consultants COULD say yes to every request, but clients pay
money for things they think are worth it.
* Your brain surgeon COULD fill your prescriptions, but you
wouldn't write him $7,500 checks to do so. You'd anticipate
forking over a $35 co-pay. Huge difference in expectations.

Consultants get to be the Ember consultant or the dev pushing the
boundaries of DevOps with Docker by saying "no" to projects that
they could do, but choose not to.

By saying "no" to that WordPress theme creation and "no" to that
MailChimp email integration, you are telling the world that you
only say "yes" to projects that fit your vision.

Your vision should be a niche so small that when your client
finds you, they feel that you were put on this earth to solve
their immediate problem.

There are three questions you'll need to answer in your
nichification process:

Who? Who is your target customer? What size is their firm?
What? What problems are you solving?
Why? Why does your client share your vision for the future?

Notice "How?" is missing. The how is not important â€” your client
doesn't care if you use Go, Io.js, or Rails to solve their
problem, just so long as it's solved.

Examples of nichified projects:

* Outsourced DevOps for consultancies so they can concentrate on
building features, not servers
* Open data solutions for big government and big charity to help
low-income populations
* Mobile software development across multiple platforms with a
shared code base
* Reservation confirmation software for doctors that work with
their current systems

Have fun saying "no!"

Positioning for Professionals ( http://www.positioningforprofessionals.com/ ), changed my outlook
on life, and I recently niched Comal.io with these techniques.
