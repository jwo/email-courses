Having no work and no leads is depressing. It can seem like you
did something wrong, that you're not good enough, that you're not
cut out for this. When many freelancers go through dry spells,
they end up back at a 9-5 with a steady salary.

An empty funnel is a symptom of not networking enough or just
some bad luck. I've had deals fall through and prospects lie
about their needs; I, too, have ended up staring at that blank
calendar.

My longest dry spell was from October to November, 2013. I had
scheduled October to host an online paid workshop, which I
canceled due to a lack of interest. That failed launch made
October a wash, and I didn't book November because of the funk I
was in. Whoops, there went all my savings.

Don't let your dry spells linger; attack them with vigor and
purpose.

Do Not

* Wait for people to contact you. It's possible you'll get
something to drop out of the sky, but you need rent-money.
* Be proactive rather than reactive.
* Go on oDesk or other freelancer marketplaces. It's a race to
the bottom; you can't compete on price with people overseas.

Do

* Contact your network and ask if they've heard of any projects
that could use your expertise.
* Email your freelance network and ask if they could use your
help on an existing project. Be prepared to lower your rate for
the project.
* Email your previous clients and ask them how their projects are
going. The goal is to re-open a conversation, gather feedback
about your impact on their businesses, and put you at the top of
their mind again.
* Write. Create articles, screencasts, and books to increase your
expertise and exposure.

Try Out

* Asking on Twitter if anyone needs your help. I tend to prefer
more direct interaction, but your mileage may vary.
* Cold email people who have posted interest in hiring
developers. See where it leads.
