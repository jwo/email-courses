I've recommended that you change your freelancing business model
significantly — something that can be fairly risky. And as you
may have guessed, I don't like taking on risk that I don't need.
Instead, I suggest you make huge, sweeping changes to your
business with little risk to next month's cash flow.

How? Apply your changes to new future deals only.

You likely get requests for quotes or pricing each month. With
the next ones that come in, apply the changes we've talked about.
For the first one that comes in, try running the show as an
expert. For another client, test out a weekly rate. Then measure
the difference.

Was it easier to close the client when you ran the show? Did you
make more money when you quoted a rate you thought was in the
ludicrous zone? Did you waste less time in pre-proposal mode by
timeboxing the initial meeting to a 30-minute Skype call?

And most importantly, did you have more freedom?

I'd bet almost certainly the answer will be yes.

P.S. In Tex Mex Consulting, I detail out a workflow for you to
implement changes like these in your business — changes that can
make you a substantial amount of money. I've taken all the
lessons I've learned over six years of consulting and then added
in wisdom from master classes that I've implemented, tested, and
loved. It's all together in a no-fluff package.
